    <section id="gear">
        <div class="container px-4 py-5">
            <h2>Choosing the Right Gear</h2>
            <p>The equipment you choose can shape the look, feel, and quality of your photography. Whether you're just starting out or ready to upgrade, understanding the key components of a camera and the strengths of different brands will help you make informed decisions.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Camera Bodies -->
    <section id="camera-bodies" class="bg-light">
        <div class="container px-4 py-5">
            <h2>Camera Bodies</h2>
            <p>The camera body is the central component where image data is captured. There are three main types: DSLR, mirrorless, and point-and-shoot. Mirrorless cameras are becoming increasingly popular for their compact size and advanced features, while DSLRs remain favored for their battery life and robust build. Point-and-shoot cameras are ideal for casual use and travel.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Canon</strong> – Known for reliability, great color science, and user-friendly interfaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Nikon</strong> – Offers excellent dynamic range and image quality, especially for outdoor photography.</li>
                <li><strong>Sony</strong> – Leads the way in mirrorless technology and low-light performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Fujifilm</strong> – Celebrated for its classic design and unique film simulation modes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Lenses -->
    <section id="lenses">
        <div class="container px-4 py-5">
            <h2>Lenses</h2>
            <p>Lenses control how the camera sees the world. Different focal lengths and apertures are used for different styles, from portraits to landscapes to macro work. Prime lenses offer sharpness and wide apertures, while zoom lenses give you versatility without switching gear.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Portraits</strong> – 50mm or 85mm prime lenses with wide apertures (f/1.8 or wider).</li>
                <li><strong>Landscapes</strong> – Wide-angle lenses (16mm to 35mm) for capturing more of the scene.</li>
                <li><strong>Sports and Wildlife</strong> – Telephoto lenses (70mm to 300mm or more) to shoot from a distance.</li>
                <li><strong>Macro</strong> – Special lenses that allow you to focus very closely on small subjects.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Accessories -->
    <section id="accessories" class="bg-light">
        <div class="container px-4 py-5">
            <h2>Accessories</h2>
            <p>Good accessories can enhance both convenience and image quality. Tripods help keep the camera steady for long exposures. Reflectors and diffusers manage lighting in portraits. Camera bags protect your gear while on the go, and filters offer creative control right on the lens.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tripods</strong> – Essential for long exposures, astrophotography, and timelapse.</li>
                <li><strong>Filters</strong> – Polarizing filters reduce glare; ND filters let you shoot wide open in bright light.</li>
                <li><strong>Lighting</strong> – External flashes, softboxes, and LED panels give you more control than natural light alone.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory and Storage</strong> – Fast SD cards and external drives ensure safe and smooth file handling.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Summary -->
    <section id="summary">
        <div class="container px-4 py-5">
            <h2>Recommendation Summary</h2>
            <p>Each brand and piece of equipment has its strengths, and the best choice depends on your style, goals, and budget. Whether you prefer Canon’s warm tones, Sony’s cutting-edge sensors, or Fujifilm’s nostalgic colors, there is something for every photographer. Take time to test out different setups and see what feels best in your hands. Investing in the right gear will not only improve your photos but also make the process more enjoyable.</p>
