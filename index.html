            <p>Photography has always been more than just a hobby for me—it is a way to connect with people, places, and moments in a way that words sometimes can’t. From the early days of capturing candid moments with family to exploring the quiet beauty of wildlife and the rhythm of street life, I’ve found that photography helps me notice the world more deeply. There is something meaningful about freezing a fleeting moment, whether it is a laugh shared at a reunion or a hawk mid-flight. Every image holds a story, and I love being the one to help tell it.

            <p>Professionally, I’ve had the opportunity to take that passion and turn it into something productive and creative through my work in media. While working with KNS Tech & Media, I created and managed social media content for several local businesses, handling everything from shooting and editing to publishing and tracking performance. That experience sharpened both my technical and storytelling skills. It taught me how powerful a single photo can be when shared with the right intention and audience. Whether I’m shooting for a client or simply walking through a city with my camera, I carry that same sense of purpose with me.</p>

            <h2>Styles of Photography</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Portrait
                    <ul>
                        <li>Headshots</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Headshot photography focuses on capturing a person's face with clarity and character, often used for professional profiles, resumes, or personal branding. The goal is to present the subject in a flattering yet authentic way, highlighting expressions and features. Headshots require careful attention to lighting, background, and pose to ensure the person looks both natural and confident. Whether taken indoors with studio lighting or outside with soft natural light, a good headshot can make a lasting first impression.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Lifestyle</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Lifestyle portraits aim to tell a story by capturing people in natural, real-life environments and situations. These photos often feature relaxed poses and candid expressions to reflect personality and emotion. Rather than formal studio setups, lifestyle portraits might be taken at home, in a park, or during a meaningful activity. They give viewers a glimpse into the subject's everyday life, and are commonly used for family shoots, personal branding, and content creation. The key is to make the subject feel comfortable so the result looks genuine and engaging.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Landscape
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nature</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nature landscape photography captures the beauty and vastness of the natural world. From mountain ranges and forests to oceans and deserts, this style aims to showcase the colors, textures, and patterns found outdoors. Timing and lighting are critical, especially during golden hour or in changing weather conditions. A strong nature landscape photo can inspire awe, calm, or a sense of adventure. It often requires patience, planning, and an eye for composition to frame the scene in a way that communicates its full impact.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Urban</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Urban landscape photography focuses on the visual elements of cities and towns, highlighting architecture, street scenes, and the rhythm of daily life. This style blends structure and spontaneity, capturing both planned design and unexpected moments. Reflections in windows, movement of crowds, and contrasts between old and new buildings often make urban landscapes compelling. Great urban photography uses lines, symmetry, and light to create images that feel alive and full of story.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Astro</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Astrophotography is a form of landscape photography that explores the night sky, capturing stars, planets, the Milky Way, and other celestial features. It requires precise settings and long exposures to bring out light from distant sources. Locations away from city lights are ideal for these images, and they often involve planning around moon phases and weather. Astrophotography combines technical skill with artistic vision, turning a dark sky into a canvas of color and movement that reveals the universe in stunning detail. Be sure to check out our Astro Photography interactive to get the best exposure for your shots!

                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Sports
                    <ul>
                        <li>Action shots</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Action sports photography is about freezing fast-paced movement in a single dramatic frame. Whether it's a soccer kick mid-air or a basketball player driving to the hoop, the goal is to capture the intensity and emotion of the moment. This style often relies on fast shutter speeds, long lenses, and precise timing. A well-timed action shot can reveal both strength and grace, and it brings the viewer directly into the excitement of the game.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Sideline candids</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sideline candid photography captures athletes in quiet moments before, during, or after the action. These shots might include emotional reactions, team huddles, or a player deep in thought. They offer a more personal look into the experience of sports, beyond just the highlight plays. Candids require a sense of timing and awareness, as the best moments are often brief and unposed. These photos can add powerful storytelling and emotional depth to any sports collection.

            <h2>Key Techniques</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Rule of Thirds</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The rule of thirds is a foundational photography principle that helps create balanced and visually engaging images. It involves dividing an image into nine equal parts by overlaying two horizontal and two vertical lines, forming a grid. Key elements of the photo, such as the subject’s eyes, the horizon, or a point of interest, are placed along these lines or where they intersect. Positioning the subject off-center this way tends to feel more natural and dynamic to the viewer than placing it in the middle. By following the rule of thirds, photographers can guide the viewer's attention and create a stronger sense of movement and space within the frame.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Depth of Field</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Depth of field refers to how much of an image is in sharp focus from front to back. A shallow depth of field means only a small portion of the image, typically the subject, is in focus while the background is blurred. This effect is often used in portraits to isolate the subject and draw attention to it. A deeper depth of field keeps more of the scene in focus, which is ideal for landscapes or architecture where you want clarity throughout the entire image. Photographers can control depth of field by adjusting the aperture, the distance to the subject, and the focal length of the lens.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Long Exposure</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Long exposure photography involves using a slow shutter speed to allow more light to hit the camera sensor over a longer period of time. This technique is great for capturing motion in a still frame, such as smoothing out water in a river, streaking lights from cars, or showing the movement of clouds. It often requires a tripod to keep the camera steady and avoid unwanted blur. Long exposure is especially popular in night photography and creative effects, where it can reveal things not easily seen by the naked eye.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Lighting Control</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lighting control is one of the most important skills in photography because it affects the mood, clarity, and impact of an image. Good lighting can define textures, set a tone, and guide the viewer's attention to the subject. Photographers use both natural and artificial sources to shape light, often with the help of reflectors, diffusers, and flash units. Understanding how light behaves, where it falls, and how to adjust it gives photographers more creative control over their final results. Whether soft and flattering or sharp and dramatic, lighting plays a key role in telling the story behind a photo.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
